Eventually, I have time to play with Graphql. In 2018, I used Apollo Server V1 with React that is hard for me to learning in short time. So now I have to learn it again but I want to build a side project that just like a basic log system for graphql server.
So I mean that I will learn about how to create Apollo Server V2 plugin for detect and measure performance of each request from Graphql Server

I hope that my project will be inspire you to learn about Graphql Server
